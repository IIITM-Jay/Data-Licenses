## Management
<p align="justify">
 The term <b><i>"Management"</i></b> always leads us to think about the ways for <i>organising, controlling</i> and most pre-eminently <i>coordinating</i> the works, events and persons together as a team so as to accomplish <b>"Team Work"</b>. <i>But have you ever give a thought that it never discusses about the location of the team members, no matter wherever you and your team members are located, whether nearby or faraway, you have to manage your tasks and work efficiently as well as productively!!!</i>:thinking: 
</p>

While working in a group or a team, every individual must take care of the following classifications of the *Management*:

1. <strong>T</strong>eam Management
2. <strong>T</strong>ime Management
3. <strong>T</strong>ask Management

 <p align="justify">
 <b><i>Team Management</i></b> is something which is not only done by the manager of the team, it's you also, as a member of the same group which constitutes finally as a team which lets you not to forget that the <b><i>Manager is also one of the member of the same  team to which you also belong.</i></b>The following points must be taken care of by both, the <i>The Manager</i> as well as the <i>The Team Member</i>:

<ul>
 <li><b>As a Manager: :man_judge:</b></li>
</ul>
  <ol>
   <li><b><i>Ensure everybody's involvement:</i></b>
    <p align="justify">
It's only the manager of the team who binds the whole team as one unit ensuring participation of each and every member of the team. Although this is one of the prominent challenging task for a manager where the team members are located remotely as all of them will have their different timezones. This issue has been discussed in

        <li><b><i>Respect and Appreciate everyone's contribution:</i></b>
             <p align="justify">
              <i>“Respect is a two-way street, if you want to get it, you’ve got to give it.”
               -R.G. Risch</i> </br>
 Manager should respect everyone and everybody's time, meanwhile appreciating their works, which will even help yu as if a manager to strengthen your bond between your team members and <b>let them feel included as a team</b>.
         </p>
<li><b><i>Solve your team members' issues:</i></b>
  <p align="justify">
   Manager should ensure that nobody is facing any type of difficulties whether it's a communication issue or a technical problem. Manager sholud keep a check on communication channels to confirm it follows through the right path and fixing out any issue , if so occured which help them to even creating the bond stronger among their colleagues.

<p align="justify">
1. <b>Participation:</b> The First <b>P</b> stands for <i>Participation</i> which emphasizes on full involvement of each and every member of a team. It's your own responsibility that you should take part in every specific discussion as one of the team member, sharing your own ideas. Of course! the manager will make ensure that everybody is present, but you should join the team by your own thought that you are also one of the <b><i>"Worthiest Member"</b></i> :busts_in_silhouette: of the team and hence you are included.
</p>
<p align="justify">
2.<b> Produce:</b> For any task to work on, the first thing is that you should have an idea to be discussed upon in a team i.e., you must <b><i> Produce</i></b> unique and varied ideas so that everybody should consider it interesting. <i>However, never hesitate to talk about the ideas with your team, no matter whether it's a small idea, your ideas are always welcome:handshake: as this is "your own team" in which you are working in.</i>
