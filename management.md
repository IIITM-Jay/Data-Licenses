## How this will help you / why this is useful
Risk assessment is so necessary as it not only identifies and determines the risk, which can cause loss or failure of the project but also helps you to have the prior knowledge of the level of risks and its consequences afterwards.  
Its Significance is not only limited to identify and detect risks, but also helps you to deal with it, providing you the protective layer against the threats and vulnerability of system security as well.
The key point is that it tracks down the risk, implying that it dig outs the appropriate path where  the flaw actually occurs which makes the process of analysing and evaluating easier and more faster.
