## How this will help you / why this is useful
Risk assessment is so necessary as it not only identifies and determines the risk, which can cause loss or failure of the project but also helps you to have the prior knowledge of the level of risks and its consequences afterwards.  
Its Significance is not only limited to identify and detect risks, but also  to deal with it, providing you the protective layer against the threats and vulnerability of system's security as well.
The key point is that it tracks down the risk, implying that it dig outs the appropriate path where  the flaw actually occurs which makes the process of analysing and evaluating easier and more faster.
Another important benefit to use risk assessment in choosing sustainable and appropriate software is that it uses risk prioritization technique under which it determines which risks will have the most potential impact on the project. This can even help in determining the extent to which the uncertainty of a risk may affect the outcome of a project in relation to the uncertainty of all other risks.
