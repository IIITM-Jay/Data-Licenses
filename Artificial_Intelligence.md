## Artificial Intelligence and Licenses
<p align="justify">
It would be unfair to judge the originality of work in the field of <b>"Ariticial Intelligence (AI)"</b>, as its algorithms differ to a large extent in the depth and breadth of input which is vitally consists of random snippets composed of thousands and millions of works required to produce articulate and cogent outputs.
  </p>
  
### Concerns regarding copyrights on AI:
* <p align="justify">
  As AI does not include any direct human involvement, and in fact humans are not the only source of the creative works and outputs so generated, the works which are solely generated by the machines without any human assistance should not be <b><i>"Copyrightable"</i></b>.
  </p>
* <p align="justify">
  Mentioned above, the demand of copyright free materials, would lead to serious consequences of limiting the innovation by dissuading the AI developers and researchers to invest time and money in the field of AI leading to decline of the same.
  </p>
* <p align="justify">
  There are two parties which claims for an authorship , one who is the <b>"Real Developer"</b> and others are the <b>"Owners"</b> i.e., who provides the financial support for AI devices and machines to work properly.
  </p>
  
### Solutions:
 * <p align="justify"> CC licenses solves much of the issues with copyrights on AI, but not actually fits with the concerns, as there are many issues which are not still addresed. Get more clarifications <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#artificial-intelligence-and-cc-licenses">here</a>.
