## Artificial Intelligence and Licenses
<p align="justify">
  The main motive to include this section uder <i>Data Licenses</i> is not to discuss about the most trending topic as so called <b><i>"Artificial Intelligence"</i></b> and its growing importance in our day-to-day life but, to develop awareness among the readers regarding its authorships and its related concerns with respect to <b>"Data Protection"</b>,and moreover it also dicusses how you can protect your data through various means as <i>Licenses,Acts,Regulations...and many more</i> whether you are a developer or the end user,  whenever anybody wants to make a move in this vast field of AI. </br>
  It's very important to know our readers that the base of this field is nevertheless the <b>"Data"</b>, and hence its a matter of concern to protect the data it includes via <i>Authorships, Settlements and Mutual Agreements</i>. 
  </p>
  
### AI Branches and Data Protection
<p align="justify">
  As AI has advanced too much, its increasing significance in the branches as depicted on the right side too has some major threats that needs to be taken careof:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Clinical AI:</b></i><p align="justify"> We all know that data related to pateint's health is needed to be feed in the AI machines, so as to have AI algorithms, the better beneficial impact to the patients to whom they are applied and resulting knowledge should lead to measurable utility for the patient and outweigh associated risks or
potential harms. But, the conern is that <b><i>there must be some regulations regarding patient privacy and their confidential data for sharing</i></b> whenever AI is used for health care purposes. Collecting, using, and sharing patient health data raise concerns about the privacy of the affected individuals, whether those concerns are consequentialist (e.g., the possibility of future discrimination based on health status) or not (e.g., dignitary concerns about others knowing embarassing and personal facts).
  </ul>
  </p>

 <ul>
    <li><b>Financial Services:</b></li><p align="justify"> Although knowing the significance of AI in the financial services, as dicussed in the left side, it always been a fraud prone area when financial related data are being stolen by some wrong persons and misused by them. It's even more challenging to train AI algorithms to decide what is fraud and what-not, and which too needs a large volume of data. Firm or industry therefore thinks for nearly thousand times and checks for any loop hole before implementing AI for financial purposes.
  </ul>
  </p>

 <ul>
    <li><b>Marketing:</b></i><p align="justify"> Whenever you are placing orders on famous marketing platforms as that of Amazon and many more, you are giving many of your datas like bank account details, and many more related to bankings which should not be leaked anyhow, although they have played a very important role in quick and faster shopping and even you can do so when you are at home. AI is learning from your shopping, the interest in various commodities as per your previous orders and hence it's clear that AI is learning from your feeded data.
  </ul>
  </p>
  
### AI Ownership and Authorship
<img src="https://github.com/IIITM-Jay/Data-Licenses/blob/master/AI.png" width="40%" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">
<p align="justify"> There are three possible parties which may have claims to the copyright of AI generated works: AI
  <b><i>Programmers; Owners</i></b> (large companies and financial investors in the AI sector); and <b><i>End Users</i></b>. When finding the best possible author, it is crucial to consider the overall social benefit of the copyright attribution process. In other words, would society benefit most if copyright is assigned to the AI programmer, the investors responsible for funding the development of the AI, or the potentially millions of end users of AI programs. To better gauge the societal impact of each party, we must first determine the ultimate goal of assigning copyright of AI generated works to human authors. Next, we can examine which party contributes most to this goal. Finally, we may deduce that the party which contributes most to the realization of this goal is best suited to posses authorship of AI generated works.
  </p>

### Some prominent challenges of AI:
* The ethical use of AI.
* Legal amenability regarding AI and the data that fuels AI.
* Preservation of Intellectual Property(IP) rights and the appropriate allotments of ownership and use rights in the components of AI.
  
### Concerns regarding Copyrights on AI:
* <p align="justify">
  As AI does not include any direct human involvement, and in fact humans are not the only source of the creative works and outputs so generated, the works which are solely generated by the machines without any human assistance should not be <b><i>"Copyrightable"</i></b>.
  </p>
* <p align="justify">
  Mentioned above, the demand of copyright free materials, would lead to serious consequences of limiting the innovation by dissuading the AI developers and researchers to invest time and money in the field of AI leading to decline of the same.
  </p>
* <p align="justify">
  There are two parties which claims for an authorship , one who is the <b>"Real Developer"</b> and others are the <b>"Owners"</b> i.e., who provides the financial support for AI devices and machines to work properly.
  </p>
* <p align="justify">
  <b>The World of Vendors and Users:</b>Generally, immense and considerable volumes of high-quality data for training are required in order to develop highly rigorous, authentic and competitive AI-based software. The  data  required  for development are handed-over to a Vendor by a User. In some cases, the data provided to a Vendor by a User is economically valuable or confidential data that is a source of a corporationâ€™s competitive edge, such as when the data is acquired by the User through enormous commitment of labor and expense or when that data is client data, production management data, or data embodying <i>"know-how"</i>. Accordingly, aligning the needs of Users with respect to their data and the needs of Vendors with respect to making use of deliverables is  a problem. 
  </p>
  
### Solutions:
 * <p align="justify"> CC licenses solves much of the issues with copyrights on AI, but not actually fits with the concerns, as there are many issues which are not still addresed. Get more clarifications <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#artificial-intelligence-and-cc-licenses">here</a>.
  </p>

* <p align="justify"> <a href="https://www.montrealdatalicense.com/en">Montreal Data License (MDL)</a>  was initiated with more clarification and explication for use cases in the field of <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>AI</b>. The main aim of MDL is to bulid a platform towards a common framework for data licensing akin to the licensing of open source software.It provides a taxonomy for the licensing of data in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
  </p>
  
* <p align="justify"> There should be mutual agreements between all the three parties in the field of AI and Machine Leanring i.e., <b><i>Developer,Owner</i></b> and <b><i>End Users</i></b>. It should be ensured that everybody is enjoying the rights as required and nobody is over enjoying the rights.
  </p>

* <p align="justify"> Ai technology requires both the <i>Software</i> as well as <i>Data Licenses</i>, and hence there must be a balance between <b>"Reusability"</b> along with the <b>"Protection"</b> of the data included in the trending filed of AI and ML.
