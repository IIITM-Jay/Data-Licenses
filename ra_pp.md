# Controlling and Organizing Project Risks
Risk assessment in a software development is a process which initiates from risk identification operation and goes on proceeding with the actions associated until its mitigation process. 
This whole process revolves as the spokes of the wheel to complete its revolution for successful risk management process in software development with an attainment of fruitful project.
These spokes represents the various typical stages of risk management process, of which risk asessment is one of the vital phases, helping the wheel to have its own balance necessary for keep on rotating. The various classical stages or steps are depicted below:

Let us emphasize more on the fourth stage, its delineating risk impact assessment or simply can be termed as risk assessment comprising of varoius tasks that includes numerous methods and techniques of prevention, mitigitaion, recovery and many more.
Before going into the details, we would like to introduce some of the useful operations and actions necessary for the previous three stages which establishes an important interconnection with the third stage:

1. **Risk Identification:**
This operation consists of identification of areas of concern, identification and evaluation of assets, and identification of security requirements.
Before commencing risk assessment, it is necessary for you to understand the organization and its capabilities as well as its goals and objectives and strategies that are in place to achieve them. 
With the main aim of attaining successful project, the first thing which is very essential in risk assessment process is to identify the ***Strengths, Weakness, Opporunities and Threats (SWOT).***


2. **Risk Analysis and Proiritization:**
The second stage of risk management emphasizes on analyzation and ranking that is risk prioritization as continuous processes and not just as a single step to be completed at one stage of the development life cycle.
While the **Risk Analysis** discusses various issues surrounding the software and its associated area of disagreements as well as identifes possible vulnerabilities, sometimes by using tools or listing the common vulnerabilities,
the **Risk Prioritization** process determines the probability of compromization, balancing the control against threat capacity to determine the likelihood 
and then sets the appropriate ranking as required followed by selecting the top N major risks on which further operations and actions are to be performed. 

## Risk Asseessment: A broader view

**I.Risk Aversion Methods:**\
1.**Risk Avoidance:** Under the context of various risk aversion methds in software development, risk avoidance is one of the elementary step
which leads to the elimination of some risks, or categories of risks by modififying the specifications and criterions of the project.
It endeavours to reconfigure the project such that the risk in the question vanishes or is reduced to an acceptable value. However, care should be taken in case of interdependencies between risks so as not to be caught in a trap which could get arose
when avoiding one known risk leads to an unknown risk of even greater threats and consequences.

2.**Risk Control:** This process refers to the procedural steps involved for the purpose of rectifying the divergence and deviations from planned goals and objectives.
It uses various tools and parameters such as early warning systems that can fetch information to assess more precisely the impacts, likelihood, or timing of a risk.

3.**Risk Transfer:** To transfer risks to parties such as contractors, sureties, or insurance firms, it is necessary to quantitatively assess the risk.
Risk transfer can be entirely appropriate when there is a mutual understanding of the risks compared to the rewards.
Without proper risk assessment it would be difficult for the project participants and the owner to determine a fair and equitable price 
that the owner should pay the contractor to bear the risks associated with specific uncertainities.

**II.Risk Mitigation Methods:**\
Following the categorised rank list of the risks on the basis of their impacts and likelihoods of failures, assumptions are to be postulated in a manner acceptable by all the project members and participants. 
**Risk assumption** asserts that if some risks that cannot ne avoided, controlled, transferred, insured, eliminated or otherwise mitigated any how, then they simply be accepted.
However, **Risk Acceptance** is a legitimate option but not actually a mitigation strategy in risk assessment.
Risk has to be accepted only in adverse predicament when the loss outweighs the benefits
and in such circumstances choosing to accept a risk is still a better option rather than spending time or money mitigating it.\
The principles of risk mitigation strategis allows us to go along with the steps that will lead to the ways of **Impact REduction**. 
It accentuates on how the various strategies of risk aversion methods should be organized and implemented in order to
enhance the performance of the software thereby minimizing the uncertainities of failures.
