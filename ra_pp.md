# Controlling and Organizing Project Risks
Risk assessment in a software development is a process which initiates from risk identification operation and goes on proceeding with the actions associated until its mitigation process. 
This whole process revolves as the spokes of the wheel to complete its revolution for successful risk management process in software development with an attainment of fruitful project.
These spokes represents the various typical stages of risk management process, of which risk asessment is one of the vital phases, helping the wheel to have its own balance necessary for keep on rotating. The various classical stages or steps are depicted below:

Let us emphasize more on the fourth stage, its delineating risk impact assessment or simply can be termed as risk assessment comprising of varoius tasks that includes numerous methods and techniques of prevention, mitigitaion, recovery and many more.
Before going into the details, we would like to introduce some of the useful operations and actions necessary for the previous three stages which establishes an important interconnection with the third stage:

1. **Risk Identification:**
This operation consists of identification of areas of concern, identification and evaluation of assets, and identification of security requirements.
Before commencing risk assessment, it is necessary for you to understand the organization and its capabilities as well as its goals and objectives and strategies that are in place to achieve them. 
With the main aim of attaining successful project, the first thing which is very essential in risk assessment process is to identify the ***Strengths, Weakness, Opporunities and Threats (SWOT).***


2. **Risk Analysis and Proiritization:**
The second stage of risk management emphasizes on analyzation and ranking that is risk prioritization as continuous processes and not just as a single step to be completed at one stage of the development life cycle. While the **Risk Analysis** discusses various issues surrounding the software and its associated area of disagreements as well as identifes possible vulnerabilities, sometimes by using tools or listing the common vulnerabilities, the **Risk Prioritization** process determines the probability of compromization, balancing the control against threat capacity to determine the likelihood and then sets the appropriate ranking as required followed by selecting the top N major risks on which further operations and actions are to be performed. 

## 3. Risk Asseessment: A broader view
