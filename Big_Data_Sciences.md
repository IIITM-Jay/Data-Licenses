# Data Sciences and Big Data
<p align="justify">
When we talk about <i>Data Sciences</i> and <i>Big Data</i>, they are nevertheless all about data. From people's way of thinking to their lifestyle and daily habits, everything has changed and yet changing with that much of speed as that of light.
  While both the terms are correlated with each other, <b>Data Sciences</b> is a vast and broader topic which covers data mining, deep learning and big data.From above, it's clear that everything depends on data and hence we should must concern about its <i>protection</i> keeping in mind the <b><i>Reusable</i></b> ,one of the underlying principles and practices of <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/rdm/fairprinciples.html">FAIR data management</a>.

## Data Licensing in Big Data:

  Data loss is one of the major problem while working on big data. While big data enables smooth life for people, meanwhile also has become a major threat regading data leakage and losses. Data may be defined with reference to their varied and sometimes overlapping legal regimes. These reigns range from absolute protections, such as those granted by copyright
for copyrighted data (e.g. videos or photos), privacy protection for personal data (e.g. name, voice, IP addresses) or
other intellectual property similar rights for confidential information (e.g. customer lists or other business information), to relative personal protections, such as the one granted by contractual agreements for instance for raw data (e.g. technical and training data used by AI systems, research data or machine-generated data.</br>
  When it comes to these protections, policymakers and regulators face the challenge of finding the right
balance between protection and access, i.e. between granting exclusive rights as an incentive for the
production of data and ensuring access to data in order to produce wider benefits for society.
