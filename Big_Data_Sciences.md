# Data Sciences and Big Data
<p align="justify">
When we talk about <i>Data Sciences</i> and <i>Big Data</i>, they are nevertheless all about data. From people's way of thinking to their lifestyle and daily habits, everything has changed and yet changing with that much of speed as that of light.
  While both the terms are correlated with each other, <b>Data Sciences</b> is a vast and broader topic which covers data mining, deep learning and big data.From above, it's clear that everything depends on data and hence we should must concern about its <i>protection</i> keeping in mind the <b><i>Reusable</i></b> ,one of the underlying principles and practices of <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/rdm/fairprinciples.html">FAIR data management</a>.

## Data Licensing in Big Data:

  Data loss is one of the major problem while working on big data. While big data enables smooth life for people, meanwhile also has become a major threat regading data leakage and losses. Data may be defined with reference to their varied and sometimes overlapping legal regimes. These reigns range from absolute protections, such as those granted by <b>copyright
  for copyrighted data</b> (e.g. videos or photos), <b>privacy protection for personal data</b> (e.g. name, voice, IP addresses) or other <b>intellectual property</b> similar rights for confidential information (e.g. customer lists or other business information), to relative <b>personal protections</b>, such as the one granted by contractual agreements for instance for <b>raw data</b> (e.g. <i>technical and training data used by AI systems, research data or machine-generated data.</i>)</br>
  When it comes to these protections, policymakers and regulators face the challenge of finding the right
balance between protection and access, i.e. between granting exclusive rights as an incentive for the
production of data and ensuring access to data in order to produce wider benefits for society.</br>
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">European Union(EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GPDR)</a> provides the platform which resolves data protection and security to wider extent.

  ## Database protection:
  <p align="justify">
  Databases may be protected in the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Data#Which_components_of_a_database_are_protected_by_sui_generis_database_rights.3F">EU by a sui generis database right</a>, while a similar protection is
granted in other countries through unfair competition law. The sui generis database right was
developed in order to protect data producers’ investments and to prevent free-riding on somebody else's
investment in creating the database. It provides that a data producer can prohibit the extraction
(downloading and transfer of data or datasets to another medium) and/or reuse (making available to the
public) of the whole or of a substantial part of a database, as long as the producer made a substantial
investment to obtain, verify and/or present the data collected. This is irrespective of the individual
copyright protection of the underlying data. Such a right may exist for both inputs or outputs.

  <b>The World of Vendors and Users:</b>Generally, immense and considerable volumes of high-quality data for training are required in order to develop highly rigorous, authentic and competitive AI-based software. The  data  required  for development are handed-over to a Vendor by a User. In some cases, the data provided to a Vendor by a User is economically valuable or confidential data that is a source of a corporation’s competitive edge, such as when the data is acquired by the User through enormous commitment of labor and expense or when that data is client data, production management data, or data embodying <i>"know-how"</i>. Accordingly, aligning the needs of Users with respect to their data and the needs of Vendors with respect to making use of deliverables is  a problem.
