## Data Mining: Safe and Protective use
<p align="justify">
From our previous discussions it's seems that nearly everything depends fully or partially on <b><i>"Data"</i></b>, whether it's a machine generated woks as that the case of AI or human created contents and documentation.
  <b>"Data Mining"</b> which sometimes also termed as <b><i>"Text and Data Mining (TDM)"</b></i>, is yet another topic to be discussed as its increasing significance in ongoing research and education.

 ## Text and Data Mining (TDM)
  <p align="justify">
  TDM is nothing but a process to collect and gather data and contents from various resources and then analyzing them for the purpose of searching, finding patterns, discovering relationships, semantic analysis and learning how content relates to ideas and needs in a way that they can benefit in the field of reaserach and education. It's main significance is found in the new trending area of <b><i>Natural Language Processing</i></b>.</br>
  From the above definition, it's clear that this process includes extraction and usage of datas and contents form other resources hence it's to be taken careof about any infrigement issues and how to use the contents safely of others licensed material and that's the main intention behind this subsection to include in the chapter <i>"License"</i> under the subchapter <b><i>"Data Licensing"</i></b> .

    <b>Financial Services:</b>Although knowing the significance of AI in the financial services, as dicussed in the left side, it always been a fraud prone area when financial related data are being stolen by some wrong persons and misused by them. It's even more challenging to train AI algorithms to decide what is fraud and what-not, and which too needs a large volume of data. Firm or industry therefore thinks for nearly thousand times and checks for any loop hole before implementing AI for financial purposes.
