## Data Mining: Safe and Protective use
<p align="justify">
From our previous discussions it's seems that nearly everything depends fully or partially on <b><i>"Data"</i></b>, whether it's a machine generated woks as that the case of AI or human created contents and documentation.
  <b>"Data Mining"</b> which sometimes also termed as <b><i>"Text and Data Mining (TDM)"</b></i>, is yet another topic to be discussed as its increasing significance in ongoing research and education.

 ## Text and Data Mining (TDM)
  <p align="justify">
  TDM is nothing but a process to collect and gather data and contents from various resources and then analyzing them for the purpose of searching, finding patterns, discovering relationships, semantic analysis and learning how content relates to ideas and needs in a way that they can benefit in the field of reaserach and education.
  From the above definition, it's clear that this process includes extraction and usage of datas and contents from other resources hence it's to be taken careof about any infrigement issues and how to use the contents safely of others' licensed material and that's the main intention behind this subsection to include here. The three basic steps necessary in the process of TDM includes:
  <ul>
  <li>Access the content</li>
  <li>Extracting the content</li>
  <li>Mining activities</li>
  </ul>

  ## Issue: Clash Between TDM and Copyright Materials :warning:

    By looking on the left side pannel, it's clear that you must take enough precautions while working with TDM. You must think hundred times of all the questions as potraited before aheading any step and working on others' materials. The main goal behind TDM should be the societal benefit atmost, considering the facts of Non-Profit Educational use and transformative (e.g., if results not public available). It must be of the nature of factual based, maintaing the copyimg amount to smaller extent and not the central amount, proportionate for purpose. In any case it should not be used  for commercial means. It should be ensured hundred times that you must not exceed beyond the scope of license, otherwise it might be the case of infringement acts. It is not the always case that the publiher will have the possibility of udertaking TDM activities to their contents but, yes might be some cases that allows to do so.

 ## Then, how to :thinking: use licensed data? :confused:
  
  
  ## Licensing your own mterial
  <p align="justify">
  CC licenses had extended their hands even to data, datasets and databases. It discusses how you can apply any <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-databases">License to your Data</a> by keeping in mind all the necessary facts which is required either when you are using <i>other's contents or licensing your own material</i>. Whenever you are applyinglicense to your work which includes incorporating of the contents of others' you must need to check that you have done fair use of that content. Moreover, it's to be noted that CC licenses do not work for <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-offer-material-under-a-cc-license-that-has-my-trademark-on-it-without-also-licensing-or-affecting-rights-in-the-trademark">trademark and logo</a> as they limits the CC licenses for sharing in most cases.
