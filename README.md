## Summary
As I have started writing on the subchapter *"Data Licenses"*, want the valuable feedbacks and suggestions. I am thinking to include the following subsections under it.
## Subsections:
 1. **Intoduction** that discusses the following:
 * Why to use Data Licenses
 * What are Data Licenses
 * A flow chart to describe various scenarios where these are applicable
 
 2. **License Creation,Adaptation and Termination** that discusses the following:
 * How to use these licenses in your own document
 * How to use other's licensed material
 * What are the consequences of termination and violating the laws abide by them
 
 3.**An extensive use of Data Licenses in Aritificial intelligence(AI)**
 
 4.**An extension to "BIG DATA SCIENCES"**
 
 5.**A Case Study**
